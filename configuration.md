# Configuration Options

The framework integration has a set of configuration options that are specific
to web applications, this configuration extends the [base configuration for the
underlying SDK](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-sdk-spec/blob/master/specifications/config.md).

The entire framework configuration reference can be found in the [web-config.yaml](web-config.yaml) file.

The configuration options inherently refer to high level features that the framework integration should implement, you will find
that each high level feature has it's own markdown file in this repository.
